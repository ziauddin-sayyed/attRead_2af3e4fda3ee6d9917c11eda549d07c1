Tutor is a "hands on" tutorial for new users of the Vim editor.

Most new users can get through it in less than one hour. The result
is that you can do a simple editing task using the Vim editor.

Tutor is a file that contains the tutorial lessons. You can simply
execute "vim tutor1" and then follow the instructions in the lessons.
The lessons tell you to modify the file, so DON'T DO THIS ON YOUR
ORIGINAL COPY.

On UNIX-like systems you can also use the "vimtutor" program.
It will make a scratch copy of the tutor first.

I have considered adding more advanced lessons but have not found the
time. Please let me know how you like it and send any improvements you
make.

All of the above regarding chapter one of the tutorial also applies to chapter
two of the tutorial.  Except that you must use the command “vim tutor2” to open
chapter two.

The chapter two of the tutorial was written by Paul D. Parker.

Translation
-----------
The files tutor1.xx for chapter one and tutor2.xx chapter two of the tutorial
are translated files (where xx is the language code).
The encoding of tutor1.xx and tutor2.xx must be utf-8.
